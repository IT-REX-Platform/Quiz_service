# Quiz Service



The Quiz Service in GITS offers a variety of quiz types to facilitate learning and assessment. These quizzes include:

### Multiple Choice Quiz

In a Multiple Choice Quiz, users must answer a set of questions. Each question presents multiple answers, with one or more being correct. Users are required to select all correct answers.

### Cloze Quiz

The Cloze Quiz prompts users to fill in the blanks within a given text, testing their understanding of the content.

### Self-Assessment Quiz

The Self-Assessment Quiz presents users with questions that require free-text responses. Users can later compare their answers with correct solutions, similar to flashcards.

### AssociationQuestion

### ExactAnswerQuestion

The Exact Answer Question presents users with questions that require precise, specific responses. Users need to provide answers that precisely match predefined correct solutions.
